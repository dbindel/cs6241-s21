## Logistical notes

- Project check-in -- let me know how things are going by a week from
  today (there will be a canvas slot).  This can be very short if
  things are going great, or more detailed if you want some feedback.
- Many of you have done enough for the weekly notebooks!  We'll
  summarize where people are next week, but would like to shift focus
  to your project for the rest of the semester.

## Scalable GPs and kernel methods

- Picking up topics from last time
- [Slides from UChigago lectures](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/present/2019-06-uchicago_kernel2.pdf)
- Some comments on current work

## Discussion (12 points, on Canvas)

1. How are things going with the class?  Given the constraints of the
   semester, do you have suggestions for things that you might like to
   see done differently as we wrap up?
2. Recognizing that students in this class come from a wide variety of
   technical backgrounds, are there particular things that we have
   treated as "pre-requisite" or outside the scope of the course that
   you would have liked to see treated more explicitly (via background
   readings, recorded supplementary lectures, something else)?
3. Tell me something you think I should know.  This can be about the
   class, about your research, or anything else.
